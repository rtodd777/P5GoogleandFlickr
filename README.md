Welcome to my Map Application which integrates both Google Maps and Flickr Images.  
The application starts by adding 9-10 Local Golf Courses to the Map which is centered around Peachtree City, GA.  
I have included courses from near by toans such as Griffen, Newnan, and Fayetteville.

You can try different function such as clicking on the icon which should turn purple and show you the course name.
The fly out menu, located on the left, provides a listing of the courses which you can also select.

Within the info window of each course, you can select "View Photos" which will pull in images from Flickr.
These images will have the title of the golf course as well as tagged "Golf".

Summer Groove seems to be the best course with the most Photos.
